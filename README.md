# Deep Learning for Crop Classification

This project demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to classify crop types using multitemporal satellite imagery. The models developed achieves high accuracy and show the potential of this approach for automated monitoring of agricultural activities.

### Background

Accurate crop type maps are essential for various agricultural applications like yield prediction, area estimation and monitoring crop growth. However, generating such maps traditionally involves extensive field surveys which are not always feasible. Deep learning models can automatically classify crop types by learning patterns in satellite image time series data.

This repository contains code to train temporal convolutional neural networks (TempCNN) model on Sentinel-2 imagery for crop/non-crop classification. The results show it is possible to map crop distributions over large areas using readily available multispectral satellite data with minimal manual effort.

### Data

The study area covers villages near Rawalpindi, Pakistan where wheat is a major crop. Sentinel-2 L2A images from 2020-2021 were downloaded. Ground truth samples of wheat and background fields were collected during field surveys.

### Methodology

Phenological curves, spectral signatures and other preprocessing steps helped understand crop growth patterns. Data was rasterized, tiled and temporally composited before training the models end-to-end. Evaluation metrics like F1-score determined the best performing model.

### Results

The TempCNN achieved an average F1-score of 0.968, outperforming the random forest models trained on Google Earth Engine. Classification maps generated by the models show their ability to accurately map wheat fields over the entire study area.

### Future Work

Some ideas for future enhancements include:
- Incorporating spatial information using CNN-RNN architectures
- Applying the methodology to other crop growing regions
- Automating field boundary delineation from classification maps
- Predicting crop yield using temporal signatures
